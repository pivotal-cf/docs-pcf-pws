TAS Portal allows you to view applications and services running for your organization on TAS for VMs. You can view dependencies, relationships, technical documentation, and the service status.

Tanzu Application Service Portal (TAS Portal) is a tool for developers built from the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) project [Backstage](https://backstage.io/).

TAS Portal consists of the following components:

* **Your organization catalog:** The catalog serves as the primary visual representation of your
  running services (components) and applications (systems).

* **TAS Portal plug-ins:** These plug-ins expose capabilities regarding specific Tanzu Application
  Service tools. The supported plug-ins are:

  * Runtime Resources Visibility

* **TechDocs:** This plug-in enables you to store your technical documentation in Markdown format in
  a source-code repository and display it alongside the relevant catalog entries.

* **Git repository:** TAS Portal stores the following in a Git repository:

  * The structure for your application catalog.
  * Your technical documentation about the catalog items, if you enable TAS Portal TechDocs
    capabilities.

You can host the structure for your application catalog and your technical documentation in the same
repository as your source code.

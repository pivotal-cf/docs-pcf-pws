title: Using App Autoscaler to scale apps in TAS for VMs
owner: App Autoscaler
---

With the Space Developer role, you can configure the App Autoscaler service in Apps Manager to scale apps in your TAS for VMs deployment.

You can use the App Autoscaler command-line interface (CLI) plug-in to configure App Autoscaler rules from the command line. For more information, see [Using the App Autoscaler CLI](using-autoscaler-cli.html).

Space Managers, Space Auditors, and all Org roles do not have permission to use App Autoscaler. For help managing user roles, see [Managing user accounts and permissions using Apps Manager](../../console/console-roles.html).


## <a id="overview"></a> App Autoscaler overview

To use App Autoscaler to scale your apps in you VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) deployment, you must create and bind the App Autoscaler service, then configure scaling rules for App Autoscaler.

For more information about App Autoscaler, including information about how to create scaling rules, see [About App Autoscaler](about-app-autoscaler.html).

## <a id="prerequisite"></a> Prerequisite

Before using the Autoscaler service in Apps Manager, you must configure the `search-server` app for any deployments that have restrictive networking policies around request proxying.

Autoscaler controls cannot appear for apps in Apps Manager if your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment has restrictive networking policies around request proxying.

To resolve this issue and enable Autoscaler controls in Apps Manager:

1. Using the cf CLI, log in to the system org and system space.
2. Locate the `search-server` app.
3. Update the `no_proxy` environment variable for the `search-server` app to include your system domain.

    ```
    cf set-env search-server no_proxy '*.SYSTEM-DOMAIN'
    ```
    where `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is the system domain configured for your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment.
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    cf set-env search-server no_proxy '*.example.com'
    </pre>

4. Restage the `search-server` app.

    ```
    cf restage search-server
    ```

## <a id="setup"></a> Configure App Autoscaler

To configure App Autoscaler:

1. Create and bind the App Autoscaler service to your app. See [Create and bind the App Autoscaler service](#create-bind-service).

1. Configure autoscaling instance limits for your app. See [Configure autoscaling for an app](#config).

### <a id="create-bind-service"></a> Create and bind the App Autoscaler service

To use App Autoscaler, you must create an instance of the App Autoscaler service and bind it to any app you want or from the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI):

* **Apps Manager**:
  1. [Create an instance of the service](../adding-services-marketplace.html).
  2. [Bind the service to an app](../adding-services-marketplace.html#bind-instance).

* **cf CLI**:
  1. [Create an instance of the service](../../devguide/services/managing-services.html#marketplace).
  1. [Bind the service to an app](../../devguide/services/managing-services.html#bind).

<p class="note important">
<span class="note__title">Important</span>
Manual scaling overrides scaling rules that you configure with App Autoscaler. If you manually scale an app bound to an App Autoscaler service instance, the App Autoscaler instance unbinds from that app, and the app scales to the manual setting. For more information, see <a href="../../console/manage-apps.html">Managing apps and service instances using Apps Manager</a>.
</p>

To enable App Autoscaler for an app:

1. In Apps Manager, select an app from the space in which you created the App Autoscaler service.

1. Under **Processes and Instances**, click **Autoscaling Deactivated** to manage autoscaling.
![Processes and Instances table](./images/scale-app.png)

1. Click **Activate Autoscaling** to activate App Autoscaler. You can then configure instance limits, scaling rules, and scheduled limit changes for the app. For more information, see [Configure autoscaling for an app](#config).

![Instance limits and scaling configuration](./images/manage-autoscaling.png)

### <a id="config"></a> Configure autoscaling for an app

App Autoscaler keeps instance counts within an allowable range defined by minimum and maximum values. The minimum and maximum values are called instance limits.

For more information about how App Autoscaler makes scaling decisions for an app, see [How App Autoscaler determines when to scale](about-app-autoscaler.html#about-scaling-decisions) in _About App Autoscaler_.

#### <a id="limits"></a> Create or change instance limits

This section describes how to create and edit instance limits for app scaling rules. You can also schedule changes to your instance limits for a specific date and time. For more information, see [Scheduled limit changes](#schedule).

To manually edit instance limits:

1. In Apps Manager, navigate to the **Overview** page for your app. Under **Processes and Instances**, click **Autoscaling Activated**.

1. In the **Instance Limits** section, set values for **Minimum** and **Maximum**.
    ![Instance limits and scaling configuration](./images/instance-limits.png)

2. Click **Apply Changes**.

#### <a id="metric"></a> Add or delete scaling rules

The following procedures describe how to add and delete scaling rules for your apps with App Autoscaler.

For more information about scaling rules and metrics in App Autoscaler, see [About App Autoscaler scaling rules](#about-scaling).

To add a scaling rule for an app:

1. In the **Manage Autoscaling** pane, click **Add Rule** next to **Scaling Rules**. The **Add Rule** pane appears.

1. From the **Rule Type** options, select the metric for the new scaling rule.

![Rule type configuration](./images/scaling-rules.png)

1. Set the minimum and maximum thresholds for the metric. For information about setting instance limits, see [About App Autoscaler scaling rules](about-app-autoscaler.html#about-scaling) in _About App Autoscaler_.

2. Select or fill in any other text boxes that appear under the threshold text boxes:
    * If you are adding an **HTTP Request Latency** rule, configure **Percent of traffic to apply**.
    * If you are adding a **RabbitMQ Queue Depth** rule, provide the name of the queue to measure.
    * If you are adding a **Custom App Metric** rule, enter your custom **Metric**.
    * If you are adding a **Custom App Metric Ratio** rule, enter values in the **Metric** and **Comparison Metric** text boxes.

3. Click **Save**.

To delete a scaling rule for an app:

1. In the **Manage Autoscaling** pane, click the trash can icon next to the rule that you want to delete.

#### <a id="schedule"></a> Create or edit scheduled limit changes

Because app demand often follows a weekly, daily, or hourly schedule, you can schedule App Autoscaler to change the allowable instance range to track expected surges or quiet periods.

To create or edit a scheduled limit change:

1. Next to **Scheduled Limits**, click **Edit**.

1. Click **Add New** to add a new scheduled limit, or select an existing entry and click **EDIT** next to the entry.

1. Edit the following values:

  * **Date** and **Time (local)**: Set the date and time of the change.
  * **Repeat (Optional)**: Set the day of the week for which you want to repeat the change.
  * **Min** and **Max**: Set the allowable range within which App Autoscaler can change the instance count for an app.

2. Click **Save**.

In time zones that observe Daylight Saving Time, Apps Manager might not account for changes in offset from UTC time when it applies scheduled limit changes. Contact [Tanzu Support](https://tanzu.vmware.com/support) if you need help.

To delete an existing entry, click the **x** icon next to the entry that you want to delete.

For example, to schedule an app to scale down for a weekend, you can enter these two rules:

1. Scale down to a single instance on Friday evening:

  * **Date** and **Time (local)**: `Dec`, `2`, `2018` and `7:00 PM`
  * **Repeat (Optional)**: `Fr`
  * **Min** and **Max**: `1` and `1`

2. Increase instances to between 3 and 5 on Monday morning:

	* **Date** and **Time (local)**: `Dec`, `5`, `2018` and `7:00 AM`
	* **Repeat (Optional)**: `M`
	* **Min** and **Max**: `3` and `5`

You can use the App Autoscaler Command-Line Interface (CLI) to control scaling apps in your TAS for VMs deployment.

## <a id='overview'></a> App Autoscaler CLI overview

The App Autoscaler CLI is an extension of the Cloud Foundry Command-Line Interface (cf CLI). You can configure and control Autoscaler from your
local command line to scale apps in your VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) deployment.

<p class="note important">
<span class="note__title">Important</span>
The return output from the App Autoscaler CLI might include odd characters in Windows shells that do not support text color. To prevent this error, run <code>SET CF_COLOR=false</code> in your Windows shell pane before you use the App Autoscaler CLI. Some Windows shells do not support the <code>CF_COLOR</code> environment variable.
</p>

## <a id='install'></a> Install the App Autoscaler CLI plug-in

Before running App Autoscaler CLI commands, you must install the App Autoscaler CLI plug-in.

To install the plug-in:

1. Download the [Tanzu App Autoscaler CLI plug-in](https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/productdownloads?subfamily=Pivotal%20App%20Autoscaler%20CLI%20Plugin) from <%= vars.product_network %>.

  <p class="note important">
  <span class="note__title">Important</span>
  There are two versions of the App Autoscaler CLI. If you install the wrong version, you cannot use it with the Autoscaler instance in your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment. For more information, see <a href="troubleshooting.html#oss-autoscaler">App Autoscaler for Cloud Foundry does not work with <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %></a> in <em>Troubleshooting App Autoscaler</em>
  </p>

1. In a terminal window, run:

    ```console
    cf install-plugin LOCATION-OF-PLUGIN
    ```

    Where `LOCATION-OF-PLUGIN` is the path to the binary file you downloaded from <%= vars.product_network %>. For example:

    ```console
    cf install-plugin ~/Downloads/autoscaler-for-pcf-cliplugin-macosx64-binary-2.0.91
    ```

    For more information about installing cf CLI plug-ins, see [Install a plug-in](../../cf-cli/use-cli-plugins.html#plugin-install) in _Using cf CLI plug-ins_.

## <a id='create-and-bind'></a> Create and bind an Autoscaler service instance

Before you can use Autoscaler, you must create a service instance of Autoscaler and bind it to your app. For more information about service instances, see [Managing service instances with the cf CLI](../../devguide/services/managing-services.html).

To create and bind an Autoscaler service instance:

1. In a terminal window, target the space in which the app you want to scale by running:

    ```console
    cf target -o ORG-NAME -s SPACE-NAME
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>ORG-NAME</code> is the name of the org containing the space in which the app you want to scale is deployed.</li>
      <li><code>SPACE-NAME</code> is the name of the space in which the app you want to scale is deployed.</li>
    </ul>

1. Create an Autoscaler service instance by running:

    ```console
    cf create-service app-autoscaler PLAN-NAME SERVICE-NAME
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>PLAN-NAME</code> is the name of the service plan you want to use for the Autoscaler service instance.</li>
      <li><code>SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME</code> is the name you want to give the Autoscaler service instance. For example, <code>autoscaler</code>.</li>
    </ul>

2. Bind the Autoscaler service instance you created to the app you want to scale by running:

    ```console
    cf bind-service APP-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>APP-NAME</code> is the name of the app you want to scale.</li>
      <li><code>SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME</code> is the name of the Autoscaler service instance in the previous step.</li>
    </ul>

Only one service instance of Autoscaler can exist in each space in an org. If you try to create more than one Autoscaler service instance in a space, the App Autoscaler CLI returns an error message. For more information, see <a href="troubleshooting.html#one-instance-per-space">One Autoscaler service instance per space</a> in <em>Troubleshooting App Autoscaler</em>.


## <a id='view-apps'></a> View apps bound to Autoscaler

You can view a list of all the apps that are bound to an Autoscaler service instance in a space.

1. In a terminal window, target the space in which you want to view apps bound to an Autoscaler service instance by running:

    ```
    cf target -o ORG-NAME -s SPACE-NAME
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>ORG-NAME</code> is the name of the org containing the space in which the apps you want to view are deployed.</li>
      <li><code>SPACE-NAME</code> is the name of the space in which the apps you want to view are deployed.</li>
    </ul>

1. Run:

    ```
    cf autoscaling-apps
    ```
    This command returns a list of apps that are bound to Autoscaler, whether autoscaling is configured for those apps, and the autoscaling limits and scaling factors that are configured for them::
    <pre class="terminal">
    Presenting autoscaler apps in org example-org / space example-space as user
    Name                  Guid                                      Enabled   Min Instances   Max Instances   Scale Up Factor   Scale Down Factor
    example-app              d0077dc5-34bd-42c7-b377-e0fcb14d67f3      true      1               4               1                 1
    example-app-2            3f8c6e84-0b6e-4ec9-9335-0aad3979d672      false     10              40              5                 2
    OK
    </pre>


## <a id='allow-autoscaling'></a> Allow autoscaling

1. To set Autoscale for your app, run:

    ```
    cf enable-autoscaling APP-NAME
    ```
    Where `APP-NAME` is the name of the app for which you want to allow autoscaling.
    <br>
    <br>
    To enable scaling of `example-app`, for example, run:

    ```
    cf enable-autoscaling example-app
    ```
    The output looks similar to this:
    <pre class="terminal">
    Enabled autoscaling for app example-app for org example-org / space example-space as user
    OK
    </pre>

By default, the upper and lower autoscaling limits for an app are <code>-1</code>. Before Autoscaler can scale an app,
you must update these upper and lower autoscaling limits. For more information, see [Configure autoscaling limits](#configure-autos-limits).


## <a id='disallow-autoscaling'></a> Disallow autoscaling

To disallow autoscaling for an app:

1. Run:

    ```
    cf disable-autoscaling APP-NAME
    ```
    Where `APP-NAME` is the name of the app for which you want to disallow autoscaling.
    <br>
    <br>
    To stop Autoscaler from scaling `example-app`, for example, run:

    ```
    cf disable-autoscaling example-app
    ```
    The output looks similar to this:
    <pre class="terminal">
    Deactivated autoscaling for app example-app for org example-org / space example-space as user
    OK
    </pre>


## <a id='configure-auto-limits'></a> Configure autoscaling limits

To configure the upper and lower autoscaling limits for an app:

1. In a terminal window, run:

    ```
    cf update-autoscaling-limits APP-NAME LOWER-SCALING-LIMIT UPPER-SCALING-LIMIT
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>APP-NAME</code> is the name of the app for which you want to configure autoscaling limits.</li>
      <li><code>LOWER-SCALING-LIMIT</code> is the minimum number of instances you want Autoscaler to create for the app.</li>
      <li><code>UPPER-SCALING-LIMIT</code> is the maximum number of instances you want Autoscaler to create for the app.</li>
    </ul>

    For example, if you run the this command, it sets the lower scaling limit for `example-app` to `20` and the upper scaling limit to `100`:

    ```
    cf update-autoscaling-limits example-app 20 100
    ```
    The output looks similar to this:
    <pre class="terminal">
    Updated autoscaling instance limits for app example-app for org example-org / space example-space as user
    OK
    </pre>

For more information about autoscaling limits, see [Autoscaling limits](productionizing-autoscaler.html#autoscaling-limits) in _Using App Autoscaler in production_.


## <a id='configure-scaling-factors'></a> Configure scaling factors

To configure scaling factors for an app:

1. In a terminal window, run:

    ```
    cf update-autoscaling-factors APP-NAME SCALE-UP-FACTOR SCALE-DOWN-FACTOR
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>APP-NAME</code> is the name of the app for which you want to configure scaling factors.</li>
      <li><code>SCALE-UP-FACTOR</code> is the number of app instances by which you want Autoscaler to scale up at a time.</li>
      <li><code>SCALE-DOWN-FACTOR</code> is the number of app instances by which you want Autoscaler to scale down at a time.</li>
    </ul>

    For example, if you run the this command, it configures Autoscaler to scale `example-app` up by 20 instances at a time and down by 10 instances at a time:

    ```
    cf update-autoscaling-factors example-app 20 10
    ```
    The output looks similar to this:
    <pre class="terminal">
    Updated autoscaling factors for app hello-app in org example-org / space example-space as user
    OK
    </pre>

For more information about scaling factors, see [Scaling factors](productionizing-autoscaler.html#scaling-factors) in _Using App Autoscaler in production_.


## <a id='autoscaling-rules'></a> Autoscaling rules and scaling metrics

Using the procedures in this section, you can configure autoscaling rules for Autoscaler to use when making scaling decisions for an app.

See also:

* For information about scaling metrics for which you can configure autoscaling rules, see [Scaling metrics](productionizing-autoscaler.html#scaling-metrics) in _Using App Autoscaler in Production_.

* For information about the scaling metrics you can use when defining autoscaling rules for Autoscaler, see [Default metrics for scaling rules](about-app-autoscaler.html#default-metrics) and [Custom App Metrics for scaling rules](about-app-autoscaler.html#custom-metrics) in _About App Autoscaler_.

### <a id='view-rules'></a> View all autoscaling rules

To view all autoscaling rules that are configured for an app:

1. Run:

    ```
    cf autoscaling-rules APP-NAME
    ```
    Where `APP-NAME` is the name of the app for which you want to view all autoscaling rules.
    <br>
    <br>
    To return a list of all autoscaling rules that are configured for `example-app`, for example, run:

    ```
    cf autoscaling-rules example-app
    ```
    The output looks similar to this:
    <pre class="terminal">
    Presenting autoscaler rules for app example-app for org example-org / space example-space as user
    Guid                                    Type             Metric   Sub Type   Service Instance   Min Threshold   Max Threshold

    10a581c5-8fb4-48a2-b4de-8bc834aac146    http_throughput                                         20              30
    OK
    </pre>

### <a id='create-rule'></a> Create an autoscaling rule

To create a new autoscaling rule for an app:

1. Run:

    ```console
    cf create-autoscaling-rule APP-NAME RULE-TYPE MINIMUM-THRESHOLD MAXIMUM-THRESHOLD --subtype SUBTYPE --metric METRIC-NAME --comparison-metric COMPARISON-METRIC-NAME --rabbitmq-instance SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
    <li><code>APP-NAME</code> is the name of the app for which you want to create an autoscaling rule.</li>
    <li><code>RULE-TYPE</code> is the rule type of the autoscaling rule that you want to create. Valid values are <code>compare</code>, <code>cpu</code>, <code>cpu_entitlement</code>, <code>custom</code>, <code>http_latency</code>, <code>http_throughput</code>, <code>memory</code>, or <code>rabbitmq</code>.

      <div class="note">
      <span class="note__title">Note</span>
          <ul>
              <li><code>http_latency</code> threshold units are in milliseconds. In general, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends that you configure the value for <code>MAXIMUM-THRESHOLD</code> to be at least twice
              the value for <code>MINIMUM-THRESHOLD</code>, to avoid excessive cycling. HTTP Request Latency is calculated from the Gorouter to the app and back to the
              Gorouter. HTTP Request Latency is not calculated between the user and the app.</li>
              <li>If you specify <code>http_latency</code> as the rule type, you must also specify a rule subtype using the <code>--subtype</code> or <code>-s</code> parameter.</li>
              <li>The <code>cpu</code> rule type is deprecated in favor of the <code>cpu_entitlement</code> rule type.</li>
              <li>If you specify <code>compare</code> as the rule type, you must also specify a scaling metric using the <code>--metric</code> or <code>-m</code>
              parameter and a comparison metric using the <code>--comparison-metric</code> or <code>-c</code> parameter.</li>
              <li>If you specify <code>custom</code> as the rule type, you must also specify a scaling metric using the <code>--metric</code> or <code>-m</code>
              parameter.</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li><code>MINIMUM-THRESHOLD</code> is the minimum threshold for the scaling metric.</li>
    <li><code>MAXIMUM-THRESHOLD</code> is the maximum threshold for the scaling metric.</li>
    <li>(Optional) Include the <code>--subtype</code> or <code>-s</code> parameter to specify a rule subtype, where <code>SUBTYPE</code> is the rule subtype you want to specify. For an
    <code>http_latency</code> rule, valid values are <code>avg_99th</code> or <code>avg_95th</code>. For a <code>rabbitmq</code> rule, a valid value is the name of the RabbitMQ queue you want Autoscaler
    to monitor. This queue must be on a RabbitMQ service instance that is bound to the app you want to scale.</li>
    <li>(Optional) Include the <code>--metric</code> or <code>-m</code> parameter to specify a scaling metric for a <code>compare</code> or <code>custom</code> rule, where <code>METRIC-NAME</code> is the name of the
    scaling metric.</li>
    <li>(Optional) Include the <code>--comparison-metric</code> or <code>-</code>c parameter to specify a comparison metric for a <code>compare</code> rule, where <code>COMPARISON-METRIC-NAME</code> is
    the name of the metric you want to compare to the scaling metric.</li>
    <li>(Optional) Include the <code>--rabbitmq-instance</code> or <code>-r</code> parameter to specify a RabbitMQ service instance for a <code>rabbitmq</code> rule, where
    <code>SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME</code> is the name of the RabbitMQ service instance you want Autoscaler to query. Defining this parameter ensures that Autoscaler does
    not unnecessarily query other RabbitMQ service instances that are bound to the app.</li>
    </ul>

            <li>If the value that you configure for <code>TIME</code> is your local time converted to UTC time, and Daylight Saving Time is observed in your
              time zone, the UTC offset for your time zone might change during the year.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li><code>LOWER-SCALING-LIMIT</code> is the minimum number of instances you want Autoscaler to create for the app during the scheduled limit change. If the current
      number of app instances is fewer than this number at the time of the scheduled limit change, Autoscaler scales the number of app instances up to this
      number.</li>
      <li><code>UPPER-SCALING-LIMIT</code> is the maximum number of instances you want Autoscaler to create for the app during the scheduled limit change. If the current
      number of app instances is greater than this number at the time of the scheduled limit change, Autoscaler scales the number of app instances down to this
      number.</li>
      <li>(Optional) Include the <code>--recurrence</code> parameter to specify the days of the week on which you want Autoscaler to re-apply the scheduled limit change,

## <a id='configure-autoscaling'></a> Configure Autoscaler by using a manifest file

You can configure autoscaling rules, scaling limits, and scheduled limit changes for Autoscaler declaratively through a manifest file. This manifest file only configures Autoscaler, and does not interfere with any other existing app manifest files in your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment.

To configure Autoscaler using a manifest file:

1. Create a YAML file that includes the following configuration parameters:

    ```
    ---
    instance_limits:
      min: LOWER-SCALING-LIMIT
      max: UPPER-SCALING-LIMIT
    rules:
    - rule_type: RULE-TYPE
      threshold:
        min: MINIMUM-METRIC-THRESHOLD
        max: MAXIMUM-METRIC-THRESHOLD
    scheduled_limit_changes:
    - recurrence: RECURRENCE
      executes_at: "TIME"
      instance_limits:
        min: SCHEDULED-LOWER-SCALING-LIMIT
        max: SCHEDULED-UPPER-SCALING-LIMIT
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>LOWER-SCALING-LIMIT</code> is the minimum number of instances that you want Autoscaler to create for the app by default.</li>
      <li><code>UPPER-SCALING-LIMIT</code> is the maximum number of instances that you want Autoscaler to create for the app by default.</li>
      <li>(Optional) If you include a <code>rules</code> block:
        <ul>
          <li><code>RULE-TYPE</code> is the type of autoscaling rule you want Autoscaler to use for autoscaling decisions. For more information about configuring autoscaling rules using a manifest file, see <a href="http-latency.html">Using HTTP Request Latency as a scaling metric</a>, <a href="rabbit-mq.html">Using RabbitMQ queue depth as a scaling metric</a>, and <a href="custom-metrics.html">Using custom scaling metrics</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><code>MINIMUM-METRIC-THRESHOLD</code> is the minimum scaling metric threshold. If the average value of the scaling metric falls below this number, Autoscaler scales the number of app instances down.</li>
      <li><code>MAXIMUM-METRIC-THRESHOLD</code> is the maximum custom scaling metric threshold. If the average custom scaling metric rises above this number, Autoscaler scales the number of app instances up.</li>
      <li>(Optional) If you include a <code>scheduled_limit_changes</code> block:
        <ul>
          <li><code>RECURRENCE</code> is the calculated value of the bitmasked days of the week on which you want Autoscaler to re-apply the scheduled limit change. For more information, see <a href="scheduled-limit-changes.html#recurrence-value">Calculating a recurrence schedule value</a> in <em>Scheduled limit changes</em>.</li>
          <li>
            <code>TIME</code> is the time, in UTC timestamp format, at which you want Autoscaler to apply the scheduled limit change. For example, <code>2032-01-01T20:00:00Z</code>.
            If the value that you configure for <code>TIME</code> is your local time converted to UTC time, and Daylight
            Saving Time is observed in your time zone, the UTC offset for your time zone might change during the year.
          </li>
          <li><code>SCHEDULED-LOWER-SCALING-LIMIT</code> is the minimum number of instances you want Autoscaler to create for the app during the scheduled limit change. If the current number of app instances is fewer than this number at the time of the scheduled limit change, Autoscaler scales the number of app instances up to this number.</li>
          <li><code>SCHEDULED-UPPER-SCALING-LIMIT</code> is the maximum number of instances you want Autoscaler to create for the app during the scheduled limit change. If the current number of app instances is greater than this number at the time of the scheduled limit change, Autoscaler scales the number of app instances down to this number.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    You must include both a `rules` block and a `scheduled_limit_changes` block must be present in your Autoscaler manifest. If you do not want to configure autoscaling rules for an app, include an empty `rules` block. If you do not want to configure scheduled limit changes for an app, include an empty `scheduled-limit-changes` block.

2. Apply the manifest file you configured in the previous step to the app you want to scale by running:

    ```
    cf configure-autoscaling APP-NAME MANIFEST-FILENAME
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>APP-NAME</code> is the name of the app.</li>
      <li><code>MANIFEST-FILENAME</code> is the filename of the manifest file you created in the previous step</code>.</li>
    </ul>

   To apply the `autoscaler.yml` manifest file to `example-app`, run:

    ```console
    cf configure-autoscaling example-app autoscaler-manifest.yml
    ```
    The output looks similar to this:
    <pre class="terminal">
    Setting autoscaler settings for app example-app for org example-org / space example-space as user
    OK
    </pre>

owner: Apps Manager

You can use Apps Manager to add and bind service instances through the Marketplace for your Tanzu for Cloud Foundry deployment. The Marketplace
offers self-service, on-demand provisioning of add-on services.

For more information about how to add Managed Services to your Cloud Foundry deployment, see the [Services](../services/index.html) topics.

To use a service with your application, you must access the Services
Marketplace, create and configure an instance of the service, then bind the
service instance to your application.

## <a id='access-marketplace'></a>Step 1: Access the Marketplace

Use the following the steps to access the Marketplace:

1. Log in to Apps Manager for your Cloud Foundry deployment.

1. In the left pane of the page, click **Marketplace**.

   You can access the Marketplace from a space page or from an app dashboard.

Use the following steps to create and configure an instance of a service:

1. In the Marketplaces, select a service.

1. Select a plan from the left column, and click **Select this plan**.

1. Complete the **Configure Instance** form with the following information:
    * **Instance Name**: Create a name for this instance of the service.
	Service instance names must be unique within a space.
    * **Add to Space**: From the drop-down menu, select the space where you want
	to add the service instance.
    * **Bind to App**: From the drop-down menu, select an app.
	Click **[do not bind]** if you do not want to bind the service instance to
	any app at this time.

1.  Click **Add** to add the service instance. PWS creates the service instance
	in the selected space. If you specify an app, PWS binds the service instance
	to the app.
